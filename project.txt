This project is a simple python server that use "uvicorn" and "fastapi" as main moduls.

fastapi: to make the api accessible and show the main page to shorten links
uvicorn: tohost the webserver

when someone visit your shortenlink, it send the user ip to a dedicated discord webhook

instruction of how to use it:

so to start you have to install a software called python (https://python.org/) i suggest the version: 3.10 of it
once its installed and you did the steps to install it correctly. when you open "CMD" aka "Command prompt" you can type: "py" and it should show you the python version and prompt you in a python console.

once python installed, download the project in a folder for example on your desktop.
if u downloaded it in zip file, you willneed to extract the archive

once download / extracted. open command prompt in the directory with the project files in it and do the following command in "CMD" : `pip install -r requirements.txt`
to install the needed dependencies

once the dependencies installed, you can start the webserver doing this command in the same cmd as you installed the dependencies:
py main.py

and now you can visit the hosted webserver at: http://127.0.0.1:8000/

go search for a long link and a discord webhook
input the long link and your discord webhook and once all this complete click "shorten" button

it will show a link bellow the button you just pressed. copy it and visit it, you will be redirected to the long link and your ip will be sent to the discord webhook.

if you want to use it as and make it work on a public ip instead of a local, just go edit the "shorten.html" file and replace "http://127.0.0.1:8000/" by : "http://(your public ip):8000/"
note that this requires an advenced level of networking and a portforwarding precedure
